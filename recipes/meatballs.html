            <p>A<strong> meatballs </strong>is ground meat rolled into a ball, sometimes along with other ingredients, such as bread crumbs, minced onion, eggs, butter, and seasoning.</p> 
            <p>The ancient Roman cookbook Apicius included many meatball-type recipes.</p>
            <p>Early recipes included in some of the earliest known Persian cookbooks generally feature seasoned lamb rolled into orange-sized balls and glazed with egg yolk and sometimes saffron. This method was taken to the West and is referred to as gilding. Many regional variations exist, including the unusually large kufte Tabrīzī from Iran's northwestern region, with an average diameter of 20 centimetres (7.9 in).</p>
            <p>Poume d'oranges is a gilded meatball dish from the Middle Ages.</p>

                    <li>minced garlic/li>

                    <li>freshly grated Romano cheese</li>
                    <li>chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
                    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>crumbled Italian bread</li>
                    <li>lukewarm water</li>
                    <li>olive oli</li>

            <h3>Preparation steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><h4>Step 1</h4><p>Combine beef, veal, and pork in a large bowl. Add garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper.</p></li>
                    <li><h4>Step 2</h4><p>Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.</p></li>
                    <li><h4>Step 3</h4><p>Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)</p></li>
                </ol>
